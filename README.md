# Paper Review: Beyond a pacemaker's entrainment limit: phase walk-through

# Abstract 
Entrainment is a universal process where a system's frequency is synchronized with an external perceived rhythm. This process occurs in various physical and biological systems. Due to its appearance in nature, it is important to study simplified models of coupled oscillators. In the paper  "Beyond a pacemaker's entrainment limit: phase walk-through", Ermentrout and Rinzel propose a simple nonlinear one-variable model of synchronized flashing fireflies [1]. In this paper review, the ideas presented by Ermentrout and Rinzel are explained, including a comprehensive analysis of the model and its contribution to understanding other oscillatory biological systems, including circadian pacemakers.
